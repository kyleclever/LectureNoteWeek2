/*
 * Notes - char Datatype and Character class
 * 
 * Things to note:
 * 
 * The 'char' datatype is pretty mundane.  It can hold one single character (char c = 'x'; works..  char c = 'xx'; does not work
 * 
 * The Character class is a wrapper class.  The Character class inherits the char class and implements a set of static methods (isLetter, isDigit, etc).
 * 
Escape Sequences:
\t	Inserts a tab in the text at this point.
\b	Inserts a backspace in the text at this point.
\n	Inserts a newline in the text at this point.
\r	Inserts a carriage return in the text at this point.
\f	Inserts a form feed in the text at this point.
\'	Inserts a single quote character in the text at this point.
\"	Inserts a double quote character in the text at this point.
\\	Inserts a backslash character in the text at this point.

 * 
 * Things to consider:
 * 
 * What does it mean when one class inherits another?
 *
